## General Info
In this project, I simply pulled the data from a database and showed it in the application. 
I made these captured data in the form of football teams. I added dark mode support in the project, thus making it easier to use at night.

## How to Use
When you open the application, you will be greeted by a list with a football league and two buttons above it.
One of these buttons goes to the activity where there are two halves of a league fixture made up of teams here.
Another button allows the application to enter or exit dark mode.

## Technologies
I developed an android application with Java and I used the data extraction and photo editing libraries from the internet. The tenologies I use are as follows;
*Java (In this project, android targetVersionsdk: 30 is used as minVersionSdk: 23.) 
*Retrofit
*Picasso
*PHP

## Additional Info
For this project, a mysql database was created on thetreemedia.com host. Then php api was written and the project was able to extract data from here.
