## General Info
In this project, I simply pulled the data from a database and showed it in the application. 
I made these captured data in the form of football teams. I added dark mode support in the project, thus making it easier to use at night.

## How to Use
When you open the application, you will be greeted by a list with a football league and two buttons above it.
One of these buttons goes to the activity where there are two halves of a league fixture made up of teams here.
Another button allows the application to enter or exit dark mode.

## Technologies
I developed an android application with Java and I used the data extraction and photo editing libraries from the internet. The tenologies I use are as follows;
*Java (In this project, android targetVersionsdk: 30 is used as minVersionSdk: 23.) 
*Retrofit
*Picasso

You can view the teams from the database. You can switch between dark mode and light mode with one click.

Thanks to the bottom navigation bar at the bottom of the screen, you can easily view the matches in the two halves of the football league.
